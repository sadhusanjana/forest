"Forest Management."</h1></p>
<p><h2 
style="color:slateblue;">
The management of forests is 
often referred to as <big> 
forestry</big>. Forest 
management has changed 
considerably over the last few 
centuries, with rapid changes 
from the 1980s onward, 
culminating in a practice now 
referred to as sustainable 
forest management. Forest 
ecologists concentrate on 
forest patterns and processes, 
usually with the aim of <i> 
elucidating cause-and-effect 
relationships</i>. Foresters 
who practice sustainable forest
management focus on the 
integration of ecological, 
social, and economic values, 
often in consultation with 
<strong>local communities and 
other stakeholders.</strong>

Priest River winding through

forestry to the eastâ€”these lot 
patterns have existed since 
the<i>mid-19th century</i></u>.
The white patches reflect areas
with younger, smaller trees, 
where winter snow cover shows 
up brightly to the astronauts.

Humans have generally<mark> 
decreased the amount of forest 
worldwide</mark>. Anthropogenic
factors that can affect forests
include logging, urban sprawl, 
human-caused forest fires, acid
rain, invasive species, and the
slash and burn practices of 
swidden agriculture or shifting
cultivation. The loss and 
re-growth of forests lead to 
a<sup> distinction 
between</sup> two broad types 
of forest: primary or 
old-growth forest and secondary
forest. There are also many 
natural factors that can cause 
changes in forests over time, 
including forest fires, 
insects, diseases, weather, 
competition between species, 
etc. In 1997, the World 
Resources Institute recorded 
that only 20% of the world's 
original forests remained in 
large intact tracts of 
undisturbed forest.[51] More 
than 75% of these intact 
forests lie in three countries:
the boreal forests of Russia 
and Canada, and the<em> 
rainforest of Brazil.</em>
